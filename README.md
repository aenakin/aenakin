# Hi there 👋👨‍💻
I'm Alex. I'm a photographer and videographer from Finland, who recently started learning how to code. 🔰 I have never coded anything before, and always have wanted to learn, so for 2022 I decided that it is time to! Follow my journey from zero to hopefully hero (or 1? isn't that how coding works?).
