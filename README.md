# Hi there 👋
I'm Alex. I'm a photographer and videographer from Finland, who recently started learning how to code. 👨‍💻 </br>
I have never coded anything before, and always have wanted to learn, so for 2022 I decided that it is time to!

Follow my journey from zero to... **1** *(get it? because coding? zeros and ones? no...? I'll see myself out...🥲)*

A little about me:
- 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently learning `.swift`
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to learn: `.java`, `.cs`, `.cpp` `.python`...
- 📍&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in an island.
- 🤓&nbsp;&nbsp; Big Star Wars fan.
- 😅&nbsp;&nbsp; My sense of humour is... *yeah*.

<!---
- 👋&nbsp;&nbsp; 
- &nbsp;&nbsp; 
- 🌍&nbsp;&nbsp; 
- 💞️&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp; I use daily: `.swift`
- 📫&nbsp;&nbsp; How to reach me via [email], [twitter].
